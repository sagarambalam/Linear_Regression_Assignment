# Linear Regression Assignment
> This case study is based on Predictive Analytics and Linear Regression(Machine Learning)
It also consists of a seperate pdf file that has answers to all the subjective questions that were given to us as part of the assignment.
I have done this case study as part of the Executive PG Diploma program of UpGrad in collaboration with IIIT Bangalore .

Language used : Python for Data Science . 
> Tools Used - Jupyter Notebook

## Business problem
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

Essentially the company wants :

To understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19, by creating a linear model.
To identify the variables affecting their revenues i.e. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. How well those variables describe the bike demands
They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## General Information
- This is an assignment given by Upgrad as a part of curriculum
- The main goal is to learn and solve a problem using regression.
- The business objective in this case is to forecast demand based on the given dataset.
- The dataset is day.csv present in the repository.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Top contributing factors for prediction of demand are:
  - Spring Season
  - Year
  - Weather being light rain or light snow
  - Windspeed
  - Month of December
- We also found that features line months and seasons exhibit seasonality in demand.
